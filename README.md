# Demo 2 Dashboard

Pipes and caves and particles!

## Hacking

    npm install
    npm start

## Development notes

 1. the particles will only line up with the graph SVG when the browser is at 1080p (fullscreen)
 2. we can hide the path tool (lower left) when ready
 3. graph svg can be replaced with the pipes when ready!  woot!
 4. the build uses Parcel, which imports SCSS files from a javascript entry point.  I know, it's weird, but it works well enough for a small project like this.  let mclayton know if any problems arise
